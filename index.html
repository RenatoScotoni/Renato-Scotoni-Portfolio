    <h1>Renato Scotoni's Programming Portfolio</h1>
    <div class= "introduction">
      <p>This is the portfolio of yours truly Renato Scotoni, collecting the best projects I have worked on throughout a semester of intense studying and work in the frigid lands of Canada.</p>
      <p>And of course, what better way to show off these marks of my knowledge than with a top 10?</p>
     </div>
     <h2>Top 10</h2>
     <div class = "topitem">
      <h3>#10: Thing 1</h3>
      <p>This is a very good description!</p>
