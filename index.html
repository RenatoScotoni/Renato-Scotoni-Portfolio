            This is the portfolio of yours truly Renato Scotoni, collecting the
            best projects I have worked on throughout a semester of intense
            studying and work in the frigid lands of Canada.

            And of course, what better way to show off these marks of my

          <p>
            "<a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">Learn Git Branching</a
            >" was a challenging experience revolving around the software Git.
            It explored most intricacies of its usage through flowcharts,
            allowing me to understand how it functions without the addition of
            GitHub. Thanks to this website, I can now say that I learned the
            most common version control tool in the world, which is a necessity
            for a modern developer.<br />However, as it only taught me in the
            abstract how to use a piece of software and not a language - what I
            learned from it does not directly help me code - I cannot rank it as
            high as other modules.

          <p>
            The <a href="https://lab.github.com/">GitHub Learning Lab</a> showed
            me where I could put my Git knowledge to good use: Microsoft's
            hosting provider is perhaps the most crucial site for a developer to
            familiarize themselves with - after all, they're hosting this very
            portfolio! Their Learning Labs may not have been ideal, but they
            built upon Learn Git Branching's solid foundation to give me a solid
            rundown of the platform's kinks.<br />Ultimately, however, I cannot
            in good faith place Git-related modules on the same level as
            learning how to code.

            was all about it. During this course, I studied the basics of the
            language, achieving a good understanding of its functioning that
            allowed me to further my ability to develop websites.<br />However,
            this gave me a rather simple understanding of the basics of JS, and
            many parts of it - such as what I'm using in this very website -
            went unmentioned. As such, it ranks lowest among Khanacademy
            courses.

              >Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</a

            particle systems, and physics to create programs which approximate
            reality. While the direct, real-world applications of this aren't
            obvious, the complexity of some of the projects definitely made me a
            better programmer.<br />In spite of the module was among the most
            engaging I have completed this semester, however, its unnecessary
            length made it, ultimately, an inefficient use of my time.

            taught me the two languages through which the Internet's

            especially interesting, as it showed me how real, modern websites
            could be designed from a graphic point of view.<br />It ranks lower
            than it could, however, as the HTML section was rather boring and
            uncomplicated.

            to speed through a course in a language I'm unlikely to use again to
            get to the interesting part was not, and the modification process
            itself was not as interesting as the process of making a new game
            from scratch would be have been.<br />However, these suboptimal
            conditions could be said to have prepared me for unexpected

            ProcessingJS through object-oriented programming, touching on
            transformations and 3D visualizations along the way. It was an
            enlightening course, deepening my knowledge of OOP and its
            applications and furthering my learning whilst not taking that long
            to complete. The 3D section was particularly eye-opening regarding
            the lower-level functioning of 3D engines.<br />For all these

          <p>
            The Snake Creative Coding Challenge was by far the best and most

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It utilizes a language, JavaScript, which is fundamental in

            </li>
            <li>
              It was developed in a group and explored extremely complex
              computer science problems, headaches and bugs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unlike previous projects, the teamwork on this one was all but
              flawless.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            During this project, we read through an implementation of the game
            Snake in P5.js and then worked to modify it as we saw fit; while
            starting with someone else's code may seem suboptimal, we ended up
            completely reengineering it regardless. At the end of the module,
            our group presented a "code walkthrough" of the original program and
            our modifications in what was, possibly, the first presentation in
            my life I ever enjoyed.<br />
